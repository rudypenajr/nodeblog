# nodeblog

This exercise was to help myself get a better understanding of node, express, and mongodb (with monk). This is somewhat of a project description I attempted to follow:

* MongoDB with monk
* Sessions
* Form Validation
* Uploading Files with Multer
* Date Formatting wtih Moment

I started off in sections taking it bit by bit, trying to mimic what Wordpress is doing.

* Section 1 - Modules, Middleware, and Template
* Section 2 - Homepage Blog Posts
* Section 3 - Add Posts & Categories
* Section 4 - View Posts BY Categories
* Section 6 - View All Categories & Link to Section  4
* Section 6 - Single Post & Comments
